    <p>Some text..You are me and I am you if you are following your passion amidst all the failures. Being in a community  of writers virtually I have learnt to live a double life consisting of both: the struggle to earn and the the struggle to live. I am a student who is trying to taste success for 21 years straight, for I have not given up and I don't plan on doing so. Fiction, Fantasy are not just genres of literature to me, they are a system of parallel worlds where everything is possible,where I live as myself, where I don't have to prove my bare existence to people.</p>
