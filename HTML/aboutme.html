            Yash Shandilya is a mechanical engineer who has no idea why he chose
            mechanical engineering, or more importantly even engineering. He
            doesn't have any pets, also he has no idea why he includes this fact
            here. He isn't as happy as he seems to be in this picture. If this
            "The Short" intrigues you, <br />GO ON!

          <h2>The Long</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            Born in Rajasthan, brought up in Nagpur, Kolkatta, Jammu, Bangalore,
            Hyderabad, he is a personified version of "Unity in diversity". Son
            of a highly spiritual mother and a hardworking father. He has
            survived through 12 years of schooling, 4 years of engineering just
            like every other youngster in India. As each year passed by, his
            interest in books and writing grew leaps and bounds. Wattpad was a
            platform he heavily relied upon, when it came to reading and writing
            when he started his journey. He has a younger brother and another
            younger brother which implies he has 2 younger brothers which in
            turn implies he is the eldest brother which in turn implies the
            responsibilities and sacrifices that come with the title. He isn't
            particularly athletic and 25 out of 24 hours in his everyday life go
            into sitting on a chair or sleeping dreaming about how his life
            would be when he becomes successful, how everyday he will get up
            from his bed to make a change to the society, how everyday he
            wouldn't have to introduce himself as he is doing now in this
            paragraph. He is yet to claim a name for himself in literature. Also
            he plans not to claim his name in his favorite field:Mechanical
            Engineering. He has decided to move his career totally to writing
            in, Oh Not Yet. He is searching for jobs as he types this 3rd person
            introduction about himself. 1 out of 100 people who start following
            their passions become successful, he is the captain of the team 99.
